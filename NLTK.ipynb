      "each player has sixteen pieces at the beginning of the game: a king, a queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns\n",
      "the game is played on a chessboard\n",
      "the chessboard has 64 fields: eight rows and eight columns\n",
      "the fields are alternately colored white and black\n",
      "the board must be laid out so that there is a black field in the lower left corner\n",
      "in order to record moves, all fields have been given names\n",
      "as seen from the white player's point of view, the rows are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; the bottom row is numbered 1, and the top row is numbered 8\n",
      "the columns are named: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\n",
      "the name of a square consists of the combination of the letter of its column and the number of its row; for example, the square in the lower left corner (for white) is named a1\n",
      "\n",
      "the players take turns making a move, starting with the white player\n",
      "a move consists of moving one of the player's pieces to another square, according to the rules that say how that piece moves\n",
      "there is a special exception, which is the castling, where in one move two pieces are moved at the same time\n",
      "a player can capture an opponent's piece by moving one of his own pieces to the square that contains an opponent's piece\n",
      "the opponent's piece is then removed from the board and is out of play for the rest of the game capturing is not mandatory\n",
      "at the start of the game, the arrangement of the pieces is as follows\n",
      "\n",
      "so, on the second row there are eight white pawns; on the seventh row there are eight black pawns\n",
      "on the first row, from left to right, there are: a rook, knight, bishop, lady, king, bishop, knight and rook\n",
      "note that in the initial setup, ladies stand on squares of their own color, and each player has a black square in the lower left corner\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the tower moves in a straight horizontal or vertical line\n",
      "the tower may not jump over other pieces.\n",
      "all squares between the square where the tower begins its move and where the tower ends its move must be empty\n",
      "as with all pieces, if the square where the rook ends its move contains an opponent's piece, this piece is captured\n",
      "the square where the rook ends its move must not contain a piece belonging to the player who also has this tower\n",
      "\n",
      "the bishop moves in a straight diagonal line\n",
      "the runner may also not jump over other pieces\n",

      "the move can also be described as: two steps horizontally and one step vertically or two steps vertically and one step horizontally\n",
      "the horse jumps: it is allowed that the square which the horse passes in its move contains any piece\n",
      "for example, white can start the game by moving his knight from b1 to c3\n",
      "horses can jump over squares with a white piece, with a black piece, and also over empty squares\n",
      "when a horse jumps over a piece, it has no effect on the piece being jumped over; as with the other pieces, a horse captures an opponent's piece by moving to the square containing that piece\n",
      "\n",
      "the pawn's moves differ depending on whether the pawn moves to an empty square, or it captures an opponent's piece\n",
      "when a pawn does not capture, it moves one step straight ahead\n",
      "if a pawn has not yet run at all, the pawn is still on the second row, then the pawn may take a double step straight forward\n",
      "for example, a pawn or d2 can be moved to d4, provided field d3 is empty\n",
      "the pawn strikes one space diagonally forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the king moves a square in any direction: horizontally, vertically or diagonally\n",
      "there is a special type of move, which is done by a king and a rook at the same time: the rokade\n",
      "the king is the most important time of the game, and one must never make moves so that the king is in check at the end of a move\n",
      "\n",
      "if certain conditions are met, then the king and the rook can perform the castling move\n",
      "this is a special kind of move, where both the king and the rook are moved\n",
      "each of the following conditions must be met if a player wants to cast\n",
      "the king doing the castling has not yet moved during the game\n",
      "the rook doing the castling has not yet moved during the game\n",
      "the king is not in check\n",
